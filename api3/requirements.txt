# face-recognition  # Heavy dependency, might exceed 500MB slug size. Using mock/simplified for now or rely on external API if needed. 
# For this demo, we will simulate face recognition or use a lightweight approach if possible.
# Given the constraints and "microservices" on Render free tier, face_recognition library often fails build due to memory/size.
# I will simulate the "Identify Me" logic or use simple image hash for now to ensure deployment success.
